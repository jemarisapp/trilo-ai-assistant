## ▪ The Challenge

### The Commissioner Crisis
Running a sports league inside Discord can be chaotic. Commissioners often manage team assignments, update win/loss records, collect weekly rankings, and approve upgrades manually. This results in inconsistent data, slower operations, and admin burnout.

**Key Pain Points Identified:**
- **Hours of Weekly Setup**: Commissioners spent 3+ hours just creating matchup channels
- **Commissioner Burnout**: Overwhelmed admins leaving leagues within 2 seasons
- **User Engagement**: Members only active during games, no engagement between matchups
- **Error Rate**: Manual data entry led to incorrect standings and frustrated users

## ▪ The Strategy

### AI-Powered Product Development
Trilo eliminates the administrative burden of running online sports leagues through AI-powered automation. By leveraging AI-assisted development, I delivered a production-ready solution 10x faster than traditional methods while maintaining enterprise-level quality.

**Core Philosophy**: *The best league management happens when nobody has to think about it.*
